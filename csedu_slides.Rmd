# Course Description 

- Analyzed Course: _Inferential Statistics_ at the University of Duisburg-Essen of the summer semester 2019
- Compulsory course for several business and economics programs
  - Weekly 2-hour lecture 
  - Weekly 2-hour exercise
  - [Kahoot!](https://kahoot.com/) games were used to interact with students during classes
  - Homework and 5 online tests were offered on the e-assessment platform [JACK](https://s3.paluno.uni-due.de/en/forschung/spalte1/e-learning-und-e-assessment)
- Information from __802__ individuals were collected from Moodle  
  - __337__ students took an exam at the end of the semester

# Data and Warning Mail Decision
- We used two data sources 
  - The first three online tests results  
  - The commutative homework points in JACK
- Logit model was used to predict students probability to past the final exam soley based on the results in the frist three online tests
  - Model was trained with the latest data obtained from the same course given two years earlier
  - We hold the lecture only every other year
- If the predicted probability was less than 0.4 the student was indicated with a warning
- However, as the online tests were not mandatory we also considered students' general activity in JACK and modified the decision on whether a mail was sent
