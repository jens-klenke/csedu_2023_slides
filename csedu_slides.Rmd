# Research Idea and Course Description 

## Research question

.blockquote[
Does objective and motivating feedback through a warning email have a positive impact on student's performance
]

--

- Analyzed Course: _Inferential Statistics_ at the University of Duisburg-Essen
- Compulsory for business and economics
  - Weekly 2-hour lecture 
  - Weekly 2-hour exercise
  - We also have other interventions
- __802__ students at the beginning of the semester
  - __337__ students took an exam at the end of the semester

---
# Treatment Assignment
<br>
<br>
- A logit model was used to predict students' probability to pass the exam based on the first 3 online tests
  - The model was trained with the latest data obtained from the previous edition of the same course

--

- If predicted probability to pass $\leq 0.4$ the student got a warning mail

???

- [Kahoot!](https://kahoot.com/) games used during classes
- Homework (formative assessment) and 5 online tests (summative assessment) on the e-assessment platform  [JACK](https://s3.paluno.uni-due.de/en/forschung/spalte1/e-learning-und-e-assessment)

# Course Timeline Main Events

knitr::include_graphics(here::here('plots/timeline_plot.png'))
```

- The shaded area indicates the period after treatment
- 57 days between the warning mail and $1^{st}$ exam 
- 113 days between the warning email and $2^{nd}$ exam

# Literature on Warning Systems in Education

.font80[
- `r TextCite(my_bib, 'Arnold2012')` investigated the effect of the signal light system at Purdue University and found a positive effect on student grades
- `r TextCite(my_bib, 'baneres2020')` implemented an early warning system but did not analyze the effect on students' performance
- `r TextCite(my_bib, 'csahin2019')` invented an _Intelligent Intervention System_ where students get feedback for each assessment
  - Students emphasized the usefulness of the system 
- `r TextCite(my_bib, 'Iver2019')` could not find an effect from their early warning system in the ninth grade
- `r TextCite(my_bib, 'Edmunds2002')` analyzed the effects of incentives on third and four-graders' reading motivation and did not find an effect
]

--
<br>
.blockquote[
- The literature on the effects of warning system is inconclusive
- Many studies analyzed the system with questionnaires

.padding_left_2[`r circle_right` We try to measure the direct effect on students' performance]

- We used the data-driven approach by `r Citet(my_bib, 'imbensoptimal2009')` to determine the bandwidth


???
- The method fits the bandwidth as widely as possible without introducing other confounding effects

# Model Assumptions

<!--
- The running variable $W$ does not (predicted probability to pass the exam) needs to be continuous around the cutoff, otherwise students could manipulate the treatment
-->

- The running variable $W$ (predicted probability to pass the exam) must not have a jump around the cutoff in the density function

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Graphical illustration of the McCrary sorting test"), echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('plots/test_cont_label.png'))
```
]

--

.pull-right-1[
<br>

- There is no jump in the density around the cutoff point of $0.4$
- $p$-value: $0.509$
- The incentive to manipulate the treatment is quite low

]

--

.pull-down[
- Also, standard IV estimation assumptions must hold

### Estimate 
- LATE: 0.193 
  - SE: 4.889
  - $p$-value: 0.968
- Bandwidth: 0.255
- $N$: 126

]

???

- theoretisch sollten Sie jetzt einen gro√üen Sprung sehen
- covariates auch getestet
- other approaches were used

---

# Empirical Results &#8212; II

- The LATE estimate is positive but not significant  
  - An estimate of $0.193$ means that students who received the warning email achieved $0.193$ points more than comparable students who did not 
  - Compared to the $60$-point exam, the effect size seems limited

--

- Bandwidth of $0.255$
  - Only students with a predicted probability $0.4$ (cutoff) $\pm \ 0.255$ (bandwidth), are included in the analysis
  
--

- This leads to the effective sample size of $126$ students

---
name: discussion
# Discussion &#8212; I

- Our RDD results do not provide evidence that the warning email has a significant effect on students' results (or behavior)
- The variance around the cutoff is relatively high, which compromises the detection of an effect 
- Many individuals are not included in the final analysis for several reasons
  - Students dropping the course
  - Students far away from the cutoff are not providing much information 

.padding_left_2[`r circle_right`  Thus precise estimation of the treatment becomes more difficult]


---
# Discussion &#8212; II

- Students also get feedback through their online tests
- The warning may also lead weak students to postpone participation to a later semester
  - The cost in our program to postpone exams is quite low
- The objective feedback and motivation from one warning email is rather small

---
name: f_reaserach
# Further Research

- The effect on the dropout rate from such warning emails or systems requires further attention 
- An automatic repeated feedback system could have a more significant impact on student's motivation
  - Detailed recurring feedback could also be used to guide students

--

<br>
.blockquote[
We see the open and transparent communication of the student's performance to the students as a positive aspect of the system

## Appendix: Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)  &#8212; I

- The treatment is __not__ randomly assigned and therefore methods like OLS are not suitable
  - Treatment is a function of the predicted probability to pass the exam   
- Consider the following __sharp__ RDD representation `r Citet(my_bib, "Huntington-Klein2022")`: 

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \alpha T_i + \beta W_i + u_i$$
.padding_left.padding_left.font80[

  <li> \(W_i\) denotes the predicted probability to pass the final exam</li>
  <li> \(T_i\) indicates if a student received a mail</li>

    <li>\(T_i = 1[W_i \leq c]\) , with \(c = 0.4\) </li>

`r exclamation` $\;$  This design is not suitable for our analysis as our groups are not perfectly separated

class: appendix eg
## Appendix: Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) &#8212; II
### Appendix: Fuzzy RDD 

- __Fuzzy__ RDD allows to analyse a treatment in a setting where the two groups are not perfectly separated
  - Only the likelihood of receiving the treatment needs to _change_
- The effect is estimated through an instrumental variable estimation 
`r Citet(my_bib, "angristidentification1996")` where in the first stage the $\widehat{T}_i$ are estimated which then are inserted in the second stage

- First Stage: 
$$T_i = \gamma_0 +\gamma_i Z_i + \gamma_2  W_i + \nu_i \qquad \quad$$

- Second Stage: 
$$Y_i  = \beta_0 + \alpha \widehat{T}_i + \delta_1 W_i + \beta X_i + u_i$$
